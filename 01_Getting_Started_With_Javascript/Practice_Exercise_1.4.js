/*

Adding comments:
 1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value. 
Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line: 
let a = 10;

2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of 
10.

3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this 
will do.

4. At the end of your JavaScript code, use a multiple-line comment. In a real 
production script, you might use this space to add a brief outline of the 
purpose of the file.

*/

let a = 10;
// Here we are setting a value of 10 

console.log(a);
// Here we are printing the output of a on console
